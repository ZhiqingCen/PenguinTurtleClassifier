# Penguins and Turtle Classifier (group project)

- Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:
  - Expanded dataset size from 450 to 6750 images using color space transformations, geometric transformations, and mixup techniques.
  - Enhanced dataset diversity and robustness, improving model training and performance.
- Model Training and Hyper-parameter Tuning:
  - Finetuned hyper-parameters and trained multiple Detection Transformer (DETR) models.
  - Achieved the best DETR model with a mean CIOU of `0.948`, demonstrating high accuracy in object localisation tasks.
- Research and Implementation:
  - Conducted comprehensive research on state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.
  - Implemented advanced techniques using Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, and documented findings in an academic report.
- Performance and Validation:
  - Ensured rigorous validation and testing of models to achieve optimal performance metrics.
  - Demonstrated proficiency in computer vision, data augmentation, and model optimization techniques.
